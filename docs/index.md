### Alternate raw link (if you prefer the raw GitHub URL)
Replace `<org-or-user>` and `<repo>` with your GitHub org/user and repository:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org-or-user>/<repo>/main/windsong_lunch.ics
```

Both the link above on this page and the raw link point to the same calendar content. Subscribing by URL ensures your calendar stays up‑to‑date when the file is refreshed weekly.
